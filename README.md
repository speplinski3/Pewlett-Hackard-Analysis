## Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
The purpose of this analysis is to take a dataset from Pewlett-Hackard, a large corporation, and determine how to strategize for the labor gap coming as many aging employees retire. The following queries were run to assess the potential efficacy of a mentorship program to train and prepare for the lack of employees due to the retiring workforce.

* If the mentorship were to run for those born in the year 1965.

## Summary

The company is facing a moment of crisis, with 24.2% (72,458) of the current company workforce entering retirement. 
The mentorship program, as it stands now, is not enough to cover the vacancies that will open at only 1,940 employees eligible for promotion. 
However, if the program were to expand to those who were born between 1956-1965, that might open up more opportunity for internal promotion to the senior positions that are vacating.
It may be worthwhile to look at younger age groups to qualify for mentorship programs, or to see if there is room for salary increase benefits for those internally promoting, as well as any new employees taken on to fill the senior management gap.
